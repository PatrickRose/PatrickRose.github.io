International officer is always a weird one, mainly because I feel mocking the wording is mocking the fact someone isn't a a native speaker.

With the Trump presidency, Brexit and Global Terrorism (*One of these things is not like the others*), the world as we know it has witnessed increased racism, sexism, religious discrimination. You and I, as home students and International students, future leaders can make the SU and the world a better place.

As a black person from Nigeria, having been at the receiving end of racism, discrimination and a particular stereotype, I know how it feels to be treated differently, and I for once want to put an end to all this (*I wish you could. I really do*) and make the world better place.

If voted into office, I will continue the Guarantor Scheme and also campaign to expand it to involve first year students (*Wait, it doesn't already!? WHAT!?*), so international students will have easy access to affordable accommodation.

Will support international student committees, provide education and learning for easy access to university financial and other support. I will support and promote International Student committee events and activities, to make it better and improved.

Will campaign and lobby the University and Government, especially Sheffield MPs, to bring back the Post Study Work Visa for International students. I will campaign rigorously on the reduction of Student fees.

Continue the campaign against Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), we will protest if we have t, to ensure the University does not increase Fees for both home and international students. 

Will advocate for SU to show international Movies and a day in week to play international Music, from Asia, Middle East, Europe and Africa. Lets truly be international (*I was about to say you don't need to worry about Europe but you probably do considering Brexit*).

Score: 6/10. Not much to say about this.

Hello! My name is Chibuike Obianyor [Cheezy] (*I really want to know the background to that nickname*). I am not only an international student, but what I like to call a second year fresher. I joined Sheffield 6 months ago, and it has been an exhilarating experience. Presently, I act in the capacity of committee member at Sheffield Raising and Giving Society, as well as team member of Railway Challenge at Sheffield. I have been able to expand my network of friends by joining various societies including the African-Caribbean Society which gave me the opportunity to socialize with students from a range of disciplines here at Sheffield.

I aim to act in the best interest of international students. (*Thank goodness, I was worried that you wouldn't*)

 If elected I plan to:

1. Support the EU students by collaborating with the Student Advice Centre and the Educational officer with respect to life post-Brexit. (*Sounds good*)
2. Sustain the #WeAreInternational campaign. With the possibility of expanding it by working hand in hand with International Students Committee, to promote the smaller ethnic groups, educate people on cultural diversity and reduce stereotyping.
3.  Strengthen the voice of the mature & postgraduate international students who may feel they are not being heard. I plan to work with the Activities Officer to tailor activities for postgraduates as well as mature student to fit their busy academic life, to create a social balance.
4.  Create an online discussion/suggestion forum to allow visiting students and other international students relay their issues so it can be addressed immediately. (*I'm sure that you won't get assholes being dickheads in there*)

Score: 1000000000000000/10. Seriously, that pun is amazing.

Hello, Ni Hao, Marhaba, Bonjour!

I am Santhana (*and I'm an alcoholic*) and I want to be your next International Students’ Officer (*DAMMIT*).

Being the Chair of the International Students’ Committee has motivated me to run for this position. I want to continue helping Students Union thrive as a ‘global village’. Defending rights of international students is my priority.

As International Students’ Officer, I will:

1) Protect Rights of International Students

- Education: Persuade the university to decrease the year in industry fees, thus making it affordable for international students to apply for work experience.

- Immigration: Lobby the university to be a key player in Brexit negotiations, so positive changes are made to Erasmus and Study Abroad. No students should be discriminated against their nationalities.

2) Foster a Diverse SU Community #ShefGlobalCitizensn

- Motivate international students to proactively engage in SU decision-making processes through ‘Run Your SU’ initiative. Their engagement with the SU is vital to shape future needs.

-Encourage students to build global connections through cultural programmes organized by the ISC and SU by:

 * Boosting society mashups. (*That sounds painful*)
 * Running cultural-themed GIAG programmes in student villages.

3) Further Empower International Students

- Work with the Welfare Officer and DSC to develop the permanent Quiet Room (*There's a joke here somewhere about me not knowing about the Quiet Room*) as a resource for anyone who needs to access it.

- Make counselling services and the Student Advice Centre more accessible, catering to broader issues beyond cultural barriers, mental health (*What other things do they need to cover though*) .

- Work with international students to enhance understanding of various health issues including safe sexual health practices.

~Shine with Santhana!~ (*Hey! That's the name of the show!*)

Score: 5/10. Meh.

Who am I? (*I don't know, and if you don't then that's a real problem*)

* Peruvian final year International Business management student, I have loved my time at Sheffield and would be delighted to make sure other international/EU students also have the best time!
*  Activities officer of the Women in Business society, working as part of a team to organize and deliver events that help members to develop their skills
*  Social secretary of the Erasmus and Exchange society (USEES), organizing events and parties that allow incoming exchange students to meet each other and integrate in the university
*  Ex-Erasmus student, I spent my second year of university at The University of Amsterdam

I am passionate about International/EU and exchange students’ rights and their experience here at the University of Sheffield. The SU has helped me to make the most of my time at university BUT, there are always ways to improve and make things better. If elected as International Students’ Officer, I will:

 * **Promote the integration of international/English students**: By encouraging more diverse flats in university accommodation and introducing schemes such a ‘Christmas Break with a local’ and ‘buddies’ (*This doesn't happen because all the international students arrive a week before everyone else...*)
 * **Eliminate health taboos and stigmas**: SHAG (*Teehee*) (Sexual Health Advice and guidance) and mental health guidance, especially catered to International students.
 * **Protect international student’s right**: (a)Represent our rights in terms of awareness/workshops of how to successfully get sponsorship to remain in the UK after graduation, (b) post-study work visa extension and (c) extending the number of guarantees the University of Sheffield provides to international students when renting private accommodation

Score: 5/10.
