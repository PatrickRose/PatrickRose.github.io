### Manifesto ###

I am passionate about the possibilities (*So...just the possibilities? There's no studies or anything like that?*) of a democratic approach to education. I want Sheffield to be a place (*It already is a place*) where citizenship is fostered (*but not adopted*), and space for an active, participatory (*isn't that implied by the word active*) democracy runs through our education policy (*we have a policy!?*). This principle should feature in every aspect of our learning, from module content to interdisciplinary study to finding new ways of learning (*because sod the old ones*). Here are my policies: (*You mean they aren't ice cream cones?*)

A Democratic Education at Sheffield (*What if I want a dictatorship education?*)

Create opportunities for students and departmental societies to organise and challenge existing learning models (*I CHALLENGE YOU TO A DUEL! I shall learn to count to one hundred through interpretive dance!*). To enable students to pursue new methodologies (*isn't Sheffield already a research led university?*), new ways of learning, confront outdated assumptions (*how about the assumption that this isn't already done?*) and influence the creation of new module subjects (*Jeeves, get me the module list for next year. Oh no man, this won't do, let's ask a student what should be on there. The physics of balloons you say? Genius! Ten points to Gryffindor!*).

To reform AchieveMore (*what now?*) and our approach to interdisciplinary study (*so, engineering using philosophers as pieces of a Newton's cradle?*). To ensure its content and value comes from a continued and meaningful consultation with students (*Students don't know anything! THAT'S WHY THEY'RE STUDENTS*).

To build an accountable model of module feedback (*What's unaccountable about the current model?*), ensuring students' concerns and suggestions are taken seriously (*aren't they?*).

Unheard Voices

To provide greater academic and personal support to part-time students (*nice idea*), giving them an education which works around their life (*Erm, you don't have the power to do that...*).

A stronger voice for postgraduate students. More support on career development for postgrads (*do they get less support than undergrads or something?*) and a stronger voice in the Union (most of them don't care. They've realised the Union is a bit of a worthless placee). Better training and support for PhD students who are involved in teaching.

I grew up in Sheffield (*ey up*) and I know the civic values of this University, and I worry that they're being eroded by marketisation (*what does that even mean!?*). I don't want our education experience to be a transaction (*It is. You pay the university money, they teach you stuff*), but a community in which citizenship and the principles of this civic institution are rediscovered.


Score: -2/10. Come on man, a lot of that is pointless.

### Manifesto ###

Hi! My name's Minesh (*and I'm an alcoholic?*) and I’m running to be your Education Officer (*DAMMIT*). Education has the power to change lives (*it also has the power to destroy them. I feel like this is the beginning of a B movie*), but there are still many things that can be done to improve it, and to make it free and accessible to all (*which evidently isn't an improvement*). This is my Mineshfesto (*Go die in a fire*)!

❶ (*Oh look at you, fancyman with your unicode characters*) No Hidden Costs (*I think I've wondered into a Quick Cash Loan ad accidentally again*)

+ Printing should be free for all students (*Meanwhile, in San This Will Get Abused Francisco...*)

+ No to exam re-sit fees (*Say no to them all you like. They'll still exist*)

+ Free dissertation & thesis binding (*Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha*)

+ Enough copies of key texts to be provided by the university (*Ahahahahahahahahahahaha*)

❷ Free Education (*FREE EDUCATION! FOR TOO LONG HAS HE BEEN LOCKED UP WHILE THATCHER CALLED HIM A TERRORIST*)

+ Fight for free education on a local and national level (*MMA style I'm assuming*)

+ Integrated Masters’ Degrees across the board to make postgraduate study more accessible (*AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*)

+ Lobby for living grants for all students (*An actual lobby filled with living grants is more realistic than what you propose*)

❸ A Better University

+ Better representation so your voices are heard (*How are we underrepresented?*)

+ Improve the feedback system by supporting PhD staff with better wages and paid training (*How does that improve the feedback system!?*)

+ More transparent university structures and democratic decision-making (*What? How does that help?*)

+ Printers in university accommodation (*Oh my goodness, an actual SENSIBLE policy. Did you fall down the stairs before writing that?*)

Vote Minesh For Education – #Min4TheWin (*Nobody uses hashtags. Nobody*)


Score: -5/10. Wow. Just, how are you ever going to do any of that.


If I were a student at Shef Uni, I'd RON the shit out of this position. Neither of them are sensible.
