International officers take the brunt of my mockery today. I said this last year, but usually the International Officer candidates say meaningful things, instead of spouting out whatever they just thought of.

### Manifesto ###

My name is Ana-Gabriela Popa (*and I'm an alcoholic?*). It may seem scary (*Goddammit, why do people keep ruining my joke. They never think of me do they?*) to run for the second time, but it’s also amazingly exciting (*I find doing this exciting, and am amazed as well*) because I love fighting (*Oh what I'd give to not read any more of this sentence*) for International students’ rights. I loved being a member and Chair (*For humour's sake, I'm going to pretend that you were a literal chair*) of the International Students’ Committee. I love the SU and the Sheffield Community (*N'awwwwww*) and I believe in their potential to thrive. I believe the plans I have laid out below will achieve that (*I'll be the judge of that*).

As International Students’ Officer, I will:

#### Campaign for Students’ Rights ####

To have a Post-Study Work Visa (*I think you might be ignored. Sorry*)

To preserve the benefits of being part of the EU (especially in terms of travelling, loans, research funding) (*1. The brackets are mine. 2. This bloody referendum is going to put a stop to that isn't it?*)

To be supported by the University as guarantor (*You've got to be kdding me, that doesn't already happen?*) when looking for accommodation (especially with the establishment of landlords’ check on right to stay in the UK) (*Two strikes on the bracket stealing. Careful*).

#### Promote Integration between Home and International students by ####

Encouraging society mash-ups (*What, at great speed? "Hey, BoardSoc, Assassins, just run at each other really quickly and see what happens!"*)

Encouraging more Home performances in International Students’ Committee events (achieving integration whilst celebrating diversity) (*LEAVE MY BRACKETS ALONE*)

Creating more residence activities (especially family friendly for students with families and activities targeting the Mature students population) (*Listen, if you use brackets all the time, then people get confused when I add my bits inline*) – work with Activities Officer (*So, do your job?*)

Support societies by offering new comprehensive training for Inclusion Officers (*That's actually a good idea. Inclusions are fun!*)

#### Empower International Students ####

“Find your feet” (*At the end of your legs*) programme to help students settle in (can be ran during Orientation/ Intro week (*If you're going to steal my brackets, at least steal them properly*) – involves two parts: 1. Factual information (ex: right mobile phone contract) (*I give up*), 2. Dealing with Homesickness (work with Welfare Officer) (*grumble*)

Leadership programme to access a platform of campaigning and activism (*What does that even mean*)

Re-analyse academic support and Course rep structure (work with Education Officer)

Score: 0/10. I'm not bitter about you stealing my brackets. No sir.
